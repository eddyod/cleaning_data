<h1>Project Assignment for Getting and Cleaning data in R</h1>
<p>This project will get, parse, clean, perform some simple descriptive
stats on a data set and create a nice tidy data output csv file.
</p>

<h2>Info from the class README</h2>
<p>You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the
following.
</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.</li>
<li>2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
for each measurement.</li>
<li>3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
data set.</li>
<li>4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
names.</li>
<li> From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
subject.</li>
</ul>
