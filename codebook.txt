<h3>This codebook will describe the tidy output that is produced for the
course project.</h3>


<p>The tidy output is a comma delimited file with the following
8 columns:</p>
<ol>
<li>Subject</li>
<li>variable</li>
<li>LAYING</li>
<li>SITTING</li>
<li>STANDING</li>
<li>WALKING</li>
<li>WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS</li>
<li>WALKING_UPSTAIRS</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first column describes the code number for the actual human
subject. The 2nd column is the full list of the variables that
observer either the mean or the standard deviation of the relevant
observations. The last 6 columns describe the activity associated for
each person and for each variable. These last six variables represent
the mean observation for each of the activities for each of the
features.
</p>
<p>This results in a tidy data file with 2581 rows of data. (not
including the header)
</p>
<h3>Example query</h3>
<p>By looking at the first row of the data file. We can find the
average BodyAccmeanX for person #1 is .22159824394 when they are Laying.
